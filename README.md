## Self-Reflection

- **How long it took me to finish this?**
This took me about 7 hours to complete from start to finish. 
-

- **What do you think of this completion time?**
I think this was a little longer than I expected to take to finish because I already had the code for three of the games. 
- 

- **In hindsight, what would you do differently?**
- I would create the lobby first and then implement each game, rather than copying over the games and then trying to route them to the lobby. 
- 

- **What resources did you use?**
- I used the game room api website for multiplayer, I used the built in copilot for playwright testing help, and I used my previous projects and code.
